      <h2>How I became a Workflow & Ops Strategist </h2>
      <p>I was retrenched during COVID, while expecting my child, such a hard season for me. I enrolled for a work-from home program that saw me signup onto Upwork and started offering virtual assistance, leveraging my background in business operations and communications.
(Guess which baby was born? Spoiler: it's a boy, aka the baby of the house).

I invested my earnings into becoming a Certified Asana Workflow Strategist. I moved from task support to building full-scale systems that founders now rely on to scale with structure. Today, I work with visionary, mission-driven founders, like those at RawFoodMealPlanner and The Brock Method, to design workflows, automate operations.
